# Hi, I'm HP 👋

I'm a Data Science apprentice in the banking sector, currently completing my degree while building real-world, portfolio-worthy projects.

🔍 I focus on:
- Building reproducible, scalable **data pipelines** using medallion architecture
- Applying **machine learning** to solve business problems in banking and call centre domains
- Designing **stakeholder-ready dashboards** in Power BI
- Writing modular, well-documented code with a strong emphasis on **auditability and clarity**

🛠️ My toolkit includes:
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, XGBoost)
- SQL (T-SQL, Terdadata SQL, joins, CTEs)
- Power BI (Sematic Models, PowerQuery, DAX, custom visuals, storytelling)
- GitHub, Prefect, and a growing interest in cloud data tools

📂 Featured Project:
Check out my [Airbnb Data Science Pipeline](https://github.com/emandhar365/dspp-airbnb-analysis) — an end-to-end project that demonstrates data engineering, machine learning, and business insight generation using public Airbnb data.

I'm always learning, iterating, and looking for ways to bridge technical depth with business impact. Thanks for stopping by!
